# Billing Button Fix - Quick Start

## Problem
The "Manage Billing" button in `/settings/billing` doesn't open the Stripe Customer Portal.

## Solution Summary
The button is now fixed with improved error handling and logging. The most common cause is that **the Stripe Customer Portal needs to be activated** in your Stripe Dashboard.

---

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Activate Stripe Customer Portal (Most Common Issue)

**Option A: Via Stripe Dashboard**
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Billing** ‚Üí **Customer portal**
3. Click the **"Activate test link"** button (or "Activate" for live mode)
4. Configure the portal settings:
   - Add business name
   - Enable features you want (invoice history, payment method update, etc.)
   - Save settings

**Option B: Quick activation link**
- Test mode: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal
- Live mode: https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/portal

### 2. Verify Your Setup

Run the test script:
```bash
node scripts/test-stripe-portal.js
```

This will check:
- ‚úÖ Environment variables are set
- ‚úÖ Stripe API connection works
- ‚úÖ Customer portal is configured
- ‚úÖ Portal session can be created
- ‚úÖ Price IDs are valid

### 3. Test the Button

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/settings/billing`
3. Click **"Manage Billing"**
4. You should be redirected to Stripe's Customer Portal

### 4. Check Browser Console for Errors

If it still doesn't work, open the browser console (F12) and look for logs:
- `[Billing] Requesting portal session...` - Button was clicked
- `[Billing] Portal response:` - Shows the API response
- `[Billing] Redirecting to portal:` - Shows the Stripe URL

Check the server logs for:
- `[Portal] User authenticated:` - User ID
- `[Portal] Creating portal session for customer:` - Stripe customer ID
- `[Portal] Portal session created successfully:` - Session ID

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Customer portal is not enabled"
**Solution:** Activate it in Stripe Dashboard (see Step 1 above)

### Issue 2: "No subscription found"
**Solution:** 
- Make sure you have an active subscription
- Check the `subscriptions` table in Supabase
- Verify `user_id` and `stripe_customer_id` are set

### Issue 3: "Missing Stripe customer ID"
**Solution:**
- Your subscription record is missing `stripe_customer_id`
- This should be set when the subscription is created via webhook
- Check your Stripe webhook configuration

### Issue 4: Button doesn't do anything (no error)
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify you're logged in
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try in an incognito window

### Issue 5: Invalid API key
**Solution:**
- Check `.env.local` has correct `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- Make sure it starts with `sk_test_` (test) or `sk_live_` (live)
- Don't confuse it with `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

---

## Environment Variables Checklist

Make sure these are in your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Required for Customer Portal
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...                              # or sk_live_... for production
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000                 # or your production URL

# Required for subscriptions (not directly for portal, but good to have)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_STARTER_PRICE_ID=price_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PROFESSIONAL_PRICE_ID=price_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_AGENCY_PRICE_ID=price_...
```
