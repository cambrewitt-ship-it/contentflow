# 🚀 Quick Launch Guide - Security Edition

## TL;DR - Can I Launch?

**Answer:** YES, after running one SQL script (10 minutes)

**Current Status:** 🟡 **CONDITIONAL GO**  
**After Fix:** 🟢 **READY TO LAUNCH**

---

## 3-Step Launch Process (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Check Current State (5 min)

1. Open **Supabase Dashboard** → **SQL Editor**
2. Open file: `verify-current-rls-status.sql`
3. Copy entire file and paste into SQL Editor
4. Click **Run**
5. Look at the **"FINAL VERDICT"** section at the bottom

**You'll see one of:**
- 🔴 **DO NOT LAUNCH** → Go to Step 2
- 🟡 **LAUNCH AT RISK** → Go to Step 2
- 🟢 **READY TO LAUNCH** → Skip to Step 3

---

### Step 2: Apply Security Fixes (10 min)

**Only if Step 1 showed 🔴 or 🟡**

1. Stay in **Supabase SQL Editor**
2. Open file: `fix-rls-security-critical.sql`
3. Copy entire file and paste into SQL Editor
4. Click **Run**
5. Wait for completion (shows green checkmarks ✅)
6. You'll see success messages at the bottom

**Common Errors (safe to ignore):**
- "policy already exists" → This is expected, script drops and recreates
- "policy does not exist" → Script handles this with IF EXISTS

---

### Step 3: Verify Everything Works (15 min)

**3A. Test Your App (10 min)**
1. Log into your app
2. Create a new post in Content Suite
3. Schedule the post to calendar
4. Edit the scheduled post
5. Delete the post

**Expected:** Everything works normally ✅

**3B. Re-verify Security (5 min)**
1. Go back to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run `verify-current-rls-status.sql` again
3. Check "FINAL VERDICT"
4. Should now show: 🟢 **READY TO LAUNCH**

---

## What Gets Fixed

### Before Fix ❌
```
calendar_scheduled_posts table:
├─ RLS Enabled: Maybe
├─ Policies: 0 or incorrect
└─ Security: ❌ BROKEN

Other tables:
├─ Policies: Exist but wrong
└─ Security: ❌ Don't check user ownership
```

### After Fix ✅
```
calendar_scheduled_posts table:
├─ RLS Enabled: ✅ YES
├─ Policies: 4 (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
└─ Security: ✅ SECURE

Other tables:
├─ Policies: Correct, check user_id = auth.uid()
└─ Security: ✅ SECURE
```

---

## Why This Won't Break Your App

```
Your App's Architecture:

Frontend → API Routes (use SERVICE ROLE key) → Database
                     ↑
              BYPASSES RLS!
```

**SERVICE ROLE KEY** = Admin access = RLS doesn't apply

So:
- ✅ Your posts still create
- ✅ Scheduling still works
- ✅ Everything works normally
- ✅ RLS only affects direct database access

---

## What You've Already Done Right ✅

1. ✅ **Rate Limiting Active**
   - Portal: 50 requests/15 min
   - API: 100 requests/15 min
   - AI: 20 requests/hour

2. ✅ **Authentication Working**
   - Token-based API access
   - Portal token validation
   - Proper session management

3. ✅ **Good Architecture**
   - API-first design
   - Service role for backend
   - No direct database access from client

4. ✅ **Error Tracking**
   - Sentry configured
   - Console logging
   - Error handling in place

**Only issue:** RLS policies need fixing (10 min fix)

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Error: "Table does not exist"

**Solution:** You might use different table names

```sql
-- Check your actual table names:
SELECT tablename 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;
```

Look for tables like:
- `calendar_scheduled_posts` or `planner_scheduled_posts`
- `calendar_unscheduled_posts` or `planner_unscheduled_posts`

Update the fix script with your actual table names.

---

### Error: "Permission denied"

**Solution:** Use admin user

- Make sure you're logged in as the database owner
- Check you're using Supabase SQL Editor (not psql)
- Try running with postgres role

---

### App Functionality Breaks After Fix

**This shouldn't happen, but if it does:**

1. Check API routes still use `NEXT_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE`
2. Look for any errors in browser console
3. Check Supabase logs for RLS policy violations
4. Verify `client_id` is included in all inserts

**Quick rollback if needed:**

```sql
-- Disable RLS temporarily (JUST FOR TESTING!)
ALTER TABLE calendar_scheduled_posts DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Then investigate what went wrong
```

**Don't leave RLS disabled in production!**

---

## Post-Launch Monitoring

### Week 1 Checklist

**Daily:**
- [ ] Check error logs (Sentry dashboard)
- [ ] Review Supabase logs for issues
- [ ] Monitor rate limiting metrics
- [ ] Verify user signups working

**End of Week:**
- [ ] Review user feedback
- [ ] Check for security alerts
- [ ] Verify backups are running
- [ ] Test data isolation (create 2 test users)

---

## FAQ - Lightning Round

**Q: Will this break my app?**  
A: No. You use SERVICE ROLE which bypasses RLS.

**Q: How long does it take?**  
A: 10 minutes to run the fix script. 30 minutes total with testing.

**Q: Can I launch without fixing?**  
A: Not recommended. Takes 30 min now, could cause months of problems later.

**Q: What if users are already using the app?**  
A: Even better! Fix it now before more data exists. Won't affect current users.

**Q: Is my data currently at risk?**  
A: Low risk because you use SERVICE ROLE. But fix it for defense-in-depth.

**Q: What's the worst that can happen?**  
A: If someone gains direct DB access, they could see all data. RLS prevents this.
