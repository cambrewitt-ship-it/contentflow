# Authentication Protection Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Middleware Protection (`src/middleware.ts`)
- **Before**: Only protected `/dashboard` routes
- **After**: Protects ALL routes except explicitly public ones

#### Public Routes (No Auth Required):
- `/` - Landing page
- `/auth/login` - Login page
- `/auth/signup` - Signup page
- `/auth/callback` - OAuth callback
- `/pricing` - Pricing page
- `/portal/*` - Client portal (uses token-based auth)
- `/approval/*` - Approval pages (uses token-based auth)
- `/api/portal/*` - Portal API endpoints
- `/api/auth/*` - Auth API endpoints
- `/api/stripe/webhook` - Stripe webhooks

#### Protected Routes (Auth Required):
- `/dashboard/*` - All dashboard pages
- `/profile` - User profile
- `/settings/*` - Settings pages
- `/admin/*` - Admin pages
- `/sentry-example-page` - Sentry test page
- All other `/api/*` endpoints - API routes

### 2. Enhanced Login Page (`src/app/auth/login/page.tsx`)
- Added `useSearchParams` to read the `redirectTo` parameter
- After successful login, redirects users back to the page they were trying to access
- Falls back to `/dashboard` if no redirect URL is provided

### 3. Dashboard Layout Protection (`src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`)
- Added client-side authentication check using `useAuth`
- Shows loading state while checking authentication
- Redirects to login if user is not authenticated
- Prevents rendering of dashboard content for unauthenticated users

### 4. Settings Layout Protection (`src/app/settings/layout.tsx`)
- Already had client-side protection in place ✓
- No changes needed

## Security Layers

Your app now has **multiple layers of authentication protection**:

1. **Server-side Middleware** (Primary Protection)
   - Runs on every request before pages are rendered
   - Redirects unauthenticated users to login
   - Preserves the original URL for post-login redirect

2. **Client-side Layout Protection** (Secondary Protection)
   - Dashboard and Settings layouts check authentication
   - Prevents content flash for unauthenticated users
   - Provides better UX with loading states

3. **API Route Protection** (API Security)
   - API routes verify Bearer tokens
   - Only allow access to user's own data
   - Return 401 errors for unauthenticated requests

4. **Row Level Security** (Database Protection)
   - Supabase RLS policies enforce data access rules
   - Even if other checks fail, database prevents unauthorized access

## Testing the Protection

### Test 1: Access Dashboard After Logout
1. Log out of your account
2. Try to access `/dashboard`
3. **Expected**: Redirected to `/auth/login?redirectTo=/dashboard`
4. **After login**: Redirected back to `/dashboard`

### Test 2: Access Settings After Logout
1. Log out of your account
2. Try to access `/settings/profile`
3. **Expected**: Redirected to `/auth/login?redirectTo=/settings/profile`
4. **After login**: Redirected back to `/settings/profile`

### Test 3: Access API After Logout
1. Log out of your account
2. Try to access `/api/clients` directly in browser
3. **Expected**: 401 Unauthorized response

### Test 4: Public Pages Still Work
1. Log out of your account
2. Access `/` (homepage)
3. **Expected**: Page loads normally
4. Access `/pricing`
5. **Expected**: Page loads normally

### Test 5: Portal Access Still Works
1. Log out of your account
2. Access a valid portal URL with token: `/portal/[token]`
3. **Expected**: Portal loads if token is valid

## What Was the Issue?

Before these changes, the middleware only checked for authentication on `/dashboard` routes. This meant:
- `/profile` was accessible without login ❌
- `/settings/*` pages were accessible without login ❌
- `/admin/*` pages were accessible without login ❌
- Most API endpoints were still protected by individual checks ✓

Now, **ALL routes require authentication** unless they're explicitly listed as public.

## Migration Notes

- No breaking changes for authenticated users
- No changes to portal or approval token-based authentication
- API endpoints continue to work with Bearer token authentication
- Existing sessions remain valid
