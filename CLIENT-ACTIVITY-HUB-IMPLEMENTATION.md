# Client Activity Hub Implementation

## Overview
Added a comprehensive "Client Activity Hub" card to the client dashboard that shows recent activity and upcoming posts at a glance.

## What's Tracked

### Recent Activity (Last 7 Days)
1. **Content Uploads** - Number of files uploaded by the client through their portal
2. **Approvals** - Number of posts the client has approved

### Upcoming Posts
1. **This Week** - Total number of posts scheduled for this week
2. **Next Post Goes Live** - Details about the next scheduled post including:
   - Date and time
   - Post caption preview
   - Target platforms (Facebook, Instagram, etc.)
   - Integration with LATE API for social media scheduling

## Implementation Details

### New API Endpoint
**Route:** `/api/clients/[clientId]/activity-summary`

**Data Sources:**
- `client_uploads` table - tracks content uploaded by clients
- `calendar_scheduled_posts` table - tracks scheduled posts and their approval status
- `portal_activity` table - logs client portal interactions
- LATE API integration - provides scheduled post status

**Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "summary": {
    "recentActivity": {
      "uploads": 5,
      "approvals": 3
    },
    "upcomingPosts": {
      "thisWeek": 7,
      "nextPost": {
        "id": "abc123",
        "date": "2025-10-05",
        "time": "14:00:00",
        "caption": "Post caption preview...",
        "lateStatus": "scheduled",
        "platforms": ["facebook", "instagram"]
      }
    },
    "details": {
      "recentUploads": [...],
      "recentApprovals": [...]
    }
  }
}
```

### Dashboard Component Updates
**File:** `src/app/dashboard/client/[clientId]/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `activitySummary` state to track activity data
- Added `fetchActivitySummary()` function to retrieve data
- Integrated with existing data fetching on client load
- Added new "Client Activity Hub" section with visual metrics

## Visual Design

The Activity Hub is displayed as a prominent card with:
- **Single column layout on the left** (takes 1/3 of the width on large screens)
- **Stacked vertical sections** for Recent Activity and Upcoming Posts
- **Color-coded metrics** for easy scanning:
  - Blue for uploads
  - Green for approvals
  - Orange for weekly posts
- **Highlighted "Next Post" card** with gradient background showing:
  - Large date and time display
  - Caption preview
  - Platform tags

## Alternative Names Considered

If you'd like to rename the "Client Activity Hub", here are some alternatives:

1. **Client Activity Hub** âœ… (Current)
2. **Activity & Upcoming**
3. **Quick Insights**
4. **Client Snapshot**
5. **Activity Dashboard**
6. **Client Overview**
7. **Engagement Pulse**
8. **Activity Center**

## Benefits

1. **Quick Status Check** - See client engagement at a glance
2. **Proactive Management** - Know when clients are active and upload content
3. **Scheduling Visibility** - Always know when the next post goes live
4. **Compact Layout** - Fits neatly in a single column on the left side
5. **LATE API Integration** - Real-time status of social media posts

## Usage

The Activity Hub automatically loads when you open a client dashboard. It refreshes whenever:
- The client data is loaded
- You navigate back to the dashboard
- You manually refresh the page

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add refresh button for manual updates
2. Add time-range filters (last 7/14/30 days)
3. Add click-through links to detailed views
4. Add charts/graphs for trend visualization
5. Add notifications for important events
6. Add export functionality for reports
