# Portal Uploads to Client Calendar Implementation

## Summary
Implemented functionality to display client portal uploads in the client dashboard calendar on the same day cards where they were uploaded, including photos and notes.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Route Enhancement (`/api/calendar/scheduled/route.ts`)
- **Modified**: GET endpoint to fetch both scheduled posts AND client uploads
- **Added**: Query to fetch `client_uploads` table data for the client
- **Returns**: Both `posts` and `uploads` arrays in the response
- **Error Handling**: Non-blocking error handling for uploads (won't fail the whole request if uploads fail)

### 2. Client Calendar UI Updates (`/dashboard/client/[clientId]/calendar/page.tsx`)

#### Interface Additions
- **Added**: `ClientUpload` interface matching the database schema
- **Fields**: id, client_id, project_id, file_name, file_type, file_size, file_url, status, notes, created_at, updated_at

#### State Management
- **Added**: `clientUploads` state to store uploads grouped by date (similar to scheduledPosts)
- **Type**: `{[key: string]: ClientUpload[]}`

#### Data Processing
- **Modified**: `fetchScheduledPosts` to process uploads data
- **Logic**: Groups uploads by date using `created_at` field converted to 'en-CA' date format
- **Mapping**: Creates date-keyed object for fast lookup in calendar rendering

#### UI Display
- **Location**: Added upload cards after scheduled posts in each day cell
- **Styling**: 
  - Blue theme (border-blue-300, bg-blue-50) to distinguish from scheduled posts
  - Upload icon indicator at the top
  - "Client Upload" label
  - Image display for image files
  - File icon display for non-image files
  - Notes section (only shown if notes exist)
  - File metadata (time uploaded, status badge)

### Visual Design
- **Upload Cards**: Distinct blue theme to differentiate from scheduled posts
- **Images**: Full-width display with border and error handling
- **Non-Images**: Icon with file name
- **Notes**: White background box with "Notes:" label
- **Metadata**: Upload time and status badge at bottom

## Data Flow

1. **Client Portal** → Client uploads content to specific day card
2. **Portal API** (`/api/portal/upload`) → Saves to `client_uploads` table with `created_at` set to target date
3. **Client Calendar API** (`/api/calendar/scheduled`) → Fetches both scheduled posts and uploads
4. **Client Calendar UI** → Groups uploads by date and displays in corresponding day cards

## Benefits

1. ✅ Client uploads now appear in the calendar immediately
2. ✅ Uploads appear on the exact day they were uploaded to
3. ✅ Photos and notes are both visible
4. ✅ Clear visual distinction between scheduled posts and client uploads
5. ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
6. ✅ Non-blocking error handling (uploads won't break the calendar)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload content in portal calendar to a specific day
- [ ] Check that upload appears in client dashboard calendar on same day
- [ ] Verify image is displayed correctly
- [ ] Verify notes are displayed if present
- [ ] Test with non-image files (should show file icon)
- [ ] Test with multiple uploads on same day
- [ ] Test with uploads on different days
- [ ] Verify existing scheduled posts still work correctly
- [ ] Verify calendar performance is acceptable

## Database Tables Used

### `client_uploads`
- Primary table for portal uploads
- `created_at` field determines which day card to display in
- Contains: file_url (photo), notes (text), file_type, status, etc.

### `calendar_scheduled_posts`
- Existing table for scheduled content
- Unchanged by this implementation
- Displayed alongside uploads in calendar

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. Add ability to convert upload to scheduled post
2. Add upload deletion from calendar view
3. Add upload editing (notes) from calendar view
4. Add drag-and-drop to move uploads between days
5. Add filtering to show/hide uploads
6. Add upload count indicator in calendar header
