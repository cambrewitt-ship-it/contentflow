# Client Logo Upload Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds the ability for users to upload their client's logo on the client dashboard level. The logo appears in the top card where the client information is displayed.

## Features Added

### 1. Database Schema
- Added `logo_url` column to the `clients` table
- Column stores the URL of the uploaded logo image
- Includes proper indexing for performance

### 2. API Endpoints
- **POST** `/api/clients/[clientId]/logo` - Upload a new logo
- **DELETE** `/api/clients/[clientId]/logo` - Remove existing logo

### 3. UI Components
- Logo display in the client dashboard top card
- Upload button with file picker
- Remove button for existing logos
- Loading states during upload/removal
- File validation (image types only, max 5MB)

## Implementation Details

### Database Migration
Run the SQL file `add-client-logo-column.sql` to add the logo_url column:
```sql
ALTER TABLE clients ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS logo_url TEXT;
```

### API Functionality
- Uses Vercel Blob storage for image hosting
- Converts uploaded images to base64 for processing
- Updates client record with logo URL
- Handles file validation and error cases

### UI Features
- Circular logo display (80x80px)
- Upload button positioned at bottom-right of logo area
- Remove button (X) positioned at top-right when logo exists
- Loading spinners during upload/removal operations
- Graceful fallback to client initial when no logo is set

## Usage

1. Navigate to any client dashboard
2. In the top card, click the upload button (blue circle with upload icon)
3. Select an image file (JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.)
4. The logo will be uploaded and displayed immediately
5. To remove a logo, click the red X button

## File Locations

- Database migration: `add-client-logo-column.sql`
- API endpoint: `src/app/api/clients/[clientId]/logo/route.ts`
- UI updates: `src/app/dashboard/client/[clientId]/page.tsx`
- Type definitions: `src/types/api.ts`

## Dependencies

- Vercel Blob storage (requires `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` environment variable)
- Supabase for database operations
- React file input handling
- Base64 image processing

## Error Handling

- File type validation (images only)
- File size validation (max 5MB)
- Network error handling
- Database update error handling
- User-friendly error messages

## Security Considerations

- File type validation on both client and server
- File size limits to prevent abuse
- Proper authentication checks
- SQL injection protection through Supabase client
