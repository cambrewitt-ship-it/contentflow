# Account Deletion Implementation

## Overview
This implementation allows users to delete their accounts permanently from the ContentFlow platform. The feature includes a secure confirmation process and proper cleanup of user data.

## Components Added

### 1. API Endpoint
**File**: `src/app/api/user/delete-account/route.ts`

- **Method**: DELETE
- **Authentication**: Bearer token required
- **Functionality**:
  - Validates user authentication
  - Deletes user profile from `user_profiles` table
  - Deletes auth user from Supabase Auth
  - Logs the deletion process for audit purposes
  - Returns success/error response

### 2. UI Components
**File**: `src/app/settings/profile/page.tsx`

- **Location**: Settings → Profile page
- **Features**:
  - Danger Zone section with red styling
  - Two-step confirmation process
  - Type "DELETE" confirmation requirement
  - Loading states during deletion
  - Error handling and display

### 3. Database Migration
**File**: `add-user-delete-policy.sql`

- Adds DELETE policy for `user_profiles` table
- Grants DELETE permission to authenticated users
- Allows users to delete only their own profiles

## Security Features

1. **Authentication Required**: All requests must include valid Bearer token
2. **User Verification**: API validates user identity before deletion
3. **Confirmation Process**: Users must type "DELETE" to confirm
4. **Audit Logging**: All deletion attempts are logged
5. **Row Level Security**: Database policies ensure users can only delete their own data

## User Experience

1. **Clear Warning**: Prominent danger zone with warning messages
2. **Two-Step Process**: Initial button click → confirmation dialog
3. **Type Confirmation**: Must type "DELETE" exactly to proceed
4. **Loading States**: Visual feedback during deletion process
5. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages if deletion fails
6. **Automatic Redirect**: Redirects to home page after successful deletion

## Data Cleanup

The deletion process removes:
- User profile from `user_profiles` table
- Auth user from Supabase Auth system
- All related data via CASCADE constraints (clients, projects, posts, etc.)

## Usage

1. Navigate to Settings → Profile
2. Scroll to "Danger Zone" section
3. Click "Delete Account"
4. Read warning message
5. Type "DELETE" in confirmation field
6. Click "Yes, Delete My Account"
7. Account will be permanently deleted

## Error Handling

- Invalid authentication → 401 Unauthorized
- Database errors → 500 Internal Server Error
- User not found → 404 Not Found
- Confirmation not typed correctly → Client-side validation

## Testing

To test the functionality:
1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/settings/profile`
3. Test the delete account flow
4. Verify database cleanup

## Database Setup

Before using this feature, run the migration:
```sql
-- Execute the contents of add-user-delete-policy.sql
```

## Notes

- This is a permanent action that cannot be undone
- All user data and associated content will be deleted
- The feature follows security best practices with proper authentication and confirmation
- Audit logging is implemented for compliance and debugging purposes
