# üöÄ Launch Readiness Report - Security Assessment

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Assessment Type:** RLS Security & Data Protection  
**Current Status:** üî¥ **DO NOT LAUNCH YET**

---

## Executive Summary

Your app **cannot launch safely** until critical RLS (Row Level Security) fixes are applied to your Supabase database. The good news: **the fix is ready and will take only 10 minutes**.

### Critical Issues Found

1. ‚ùå **calendar_scheduled_posts** table likely has NO RLS policies (all scheduled posts exposed)
2. ‚ùå **Multiple tables** have incorrect RLS policies that don't verify user ownership
3. ‚ùå **Overly permissive** INSERT policies allow any user to create posts for any client
4. ‚ùå **client_uploads** table has broken RLS policies

### Impact Assessment

**If you launch without fixes:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Users could potentially access other users' scheduled posts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Any authenticated user could create content for clients they don't own
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Direct database access bypasses all security (via leaked keys or SQL injection)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Portal tokens might provide access to wrong client data

**Important Note:** Your app won't "break" because you use SERVICE ROLE keys in API routes (which bypass RLS), but you'll be **completely unprotected** against:
- Leaked API keys
- Direct database access
- SQL injection attacks
- Malicious users with Supabase credentials

---

## Step 1: Verify Your Current Database State (5 minutes)

I've created a diagnostic script to check your **actual** database (not just migration files).

### Run This Now:

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí Go to SQL Editor
2. **Open the file:** `verify-current-rls-status.sql` (I just created it)
3. **Copy all contents** and paste into Supabase SQL Editor
4. **Run the query**
5. **Review the output** - it will tell you exactly what's wrong

The script will show you:
- ‚úÖ Which tables have RLS enabled
- ‚ùå Which tables are missing policies
- üîç Which policies are incorrect
- üéØ Final verdict: READY / NOT READY / AT RISK

### Expected Results

If you see **üî¥ DO NOT LAUNCH** or **üü° LAUNCH AT RISK**, proceed to Step 2.

---

## Step 2: Apply Security Fixes (10 minutes)

### The Fix

I've already created the complete fix script: **`fix-rls-security-critical.sql`**

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Enable RLS on calendar_scheduled_posts
- ‚úÖ Add proper RLS policies to all tables
- ‚úÖ Fix incorrect policies to check user_id = auth.uid()
- ‚úÖ Remove overly permissive policies
- ‚úÖ Verify all tables are secure

### How to Apply

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. **Open file:** `fix-rls-security-critical.sql`
3. **Copy entire contents**
4. **Paste into Supabase SQL Editor**
5. **Run the script**
6. **Verify success** - should see green checkmarks ‚úÖ

### What Gets Fixed

**Before:**
```sql
-- ‚ùå INCORRECT - Doesn't check user ownership
CREATE POLICY "Users can view posts" ON posts
  FOR SELECT USING (
    client_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM clients 
      WHERE id = posts.client_id  -- Just checks if client exists!
    )
  );
```

**After:**
```sql
-- ‚úÖ CORRECT - Checks user owns the client
CREATE POLICY "Users can view posts for their clients" ON posts
  FOR SELECT USING (
    client_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM clients 
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()  -- Verifies ownership!
    )
  );
```

---

## Step 3: Test Security (15 minutes)

After applying fixes, verify everything works:

### Test 1: Your App Still Works ‚úÖ

1. Create a new post in Content Suite
2. Schedule the post to the calendar
3. Edit the scheduled post
4. Delete a post

**Expected:** Everything should work exactly as before (your API uses SERVICE ROLE)

### Test 2: User Isolation Works ‚úÖ

1. Create 2 test user accounts:
   - user-a@test.com
   - user-b@test.com

2. Log in as User A:
   - Create a client "Client A"
   - Create a post for Client A
   - Note the client UUID

3. Log in as User B:
   - Try to access Client A's data via API
   - Should get empty results / 403 error

4. In Supabase SQL Editor, run as User A:
   ```sql
   -- This should return ONLY User A's clients
   SELECT * FROM clients;
   
   -- This should return 0 rows
   SELECT * FROM clients WHERE user_id != auth.uid();
   ```

### Test 3: Portal Access (If You Use Portal)

1. Generate a portal token for a client
2. Access portal with valid token ‚Üí should work
3. Try accessing another client's data ‚Üí should fail
4. Use invalid token ‚Üí should get 401 error

---

## Step 4: Additional Security Hardening (Optional, 30 minutes)

These aren't blockers for launch, but strongly recommended:

### 4.1 Add Rate Limiting to Portal

Your portal endpoints need rate limiting:

```typescript
// In your portal API routes
import { rateLimit } from '@/lib/rate-limit';

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  // Add this at the start of portal routes
  const ip = request.ip ?? 'unknown';
  const { success } = await rateLimit.check(ip, 'portal', 100, 3600); // 100 req/hour
  
  if (!success) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: 'Rate limit exceeded' }, 
      { status: 429 }
    );
  }
  
  // ... rest of your code
}
```

**Files to update:**
- `/api/portal/validate/route.ts`
- `/api/portal/calendar/route.ts`
- `/api/portal/approvals/route.ts`
- `/api/portal/upload/route.ts`

### 4.2 Add Portal Token Expiration

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
ALTER TABLE clients 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS portal_token_expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;

-- Set default expiration: 90 days from now for existing tokens
UPDATE clients 
SET portal_token_expires_at = NOW() + INTERVAL '90 days'
WHERE portal_token IS NOT NULL 
AND portal_token_expires_at IS NULL;
```

Then update your portal validation logic to check expiration.

### 4.3 Enable Supabase Backups

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Settings ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Backups
3. Enable daily automated backups
4. Test restore process with a backup

### 4.4 Set Up Monitoring

Consider adding:
- Sentry for error tracking (you already have it configured!)
- Supabase logs monitoring for failed auth attempts
- Alert on unusual API patterns

## What Your Current Architecture Does Right ‚úÖ

Good news - you've done several things correctly:

### 1. Service Role Pattern ‚úÖ
- All API routes use SERVICE ROLE key
- Client-side code uses ANON key (correct!)
- You never expose service role to client

### 2. API-First Architecture ‚úÖ
- Frontend calls APIs, not direct DB
- All CRUD operations go through your API
- Service role bypasses RLS for API operations

### 3. Authentication ‚úÖ
- You check auth tokens in API routes
- Portal validates tokens before access
- User context is maintained

### 4. Data Structure ‚úÖ
- Proper foreign keys (client_id references)
- Indexes on frequently queried columns
- Timestamps for audit trails

## FAQ

### Q: Will applying RLS fixes break my app?

**A: No.** Your app uses SERVICE ROLE keys in all API routes, which bypass RLS. RLS only affects:
- Direct database access (via Supabase dashboard)
- If someone steals your anon key
- Realtime subscriptions (if you use them)

Your post creation, scheduling, editing, and deletion flows will work exactly as before.

### Q: Why wasn't RLS set up correctly from the start?

**A:** Your migration files have incorrect RLS patterns. The most common pattern in your codebase is:

```sql
WHERE id = table_name.client_id  -- ‚ùå Doesn't check user ownership
```

Instead of:

```sql
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()  -- ‚úÖ Checks user owns the client
```

This is a common mistake - the first pattern just checks if the client exists, not if the user owns it.

### Q: Can I launch and fix RLS later?

**A: Not recommended.** Here's why:

1. **Data breach risk:** Without RLS, anyone with database access can see all data
2. **Harder to fix later:** More data = more complex migration
3. **Compliance issues:** Violates data protection best practices
4. **User trust:** A data breach at launch destroys credibility

**Fix now = 30 minutes. Fix after breach = months of damage control.**

### Q: How do I know if the fix worked?

Run this query after applying fixes:

```sql
-- Should return: calendar_scheduled_posts, 4 policies
SELECT 
    tablename,
    COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'calendar_scheduled_posts'
GROUP BY tablename;
```

If you see **4 policies**, you're good! ‚úÖ

### Q: What if I see errors when running the fix script?

Common errors and solutions:

**Error:** `policy "name" already exists`  
**Solution:** The script includes `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` statements. This error means policies exist but are incorrect. The script will drop and recreate them correctly.

**Error:** `table "calendar_scheduled_posts" does not exist`  
**Solution:** You might be using a different table name. Check your actual table names with:
```sql
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

**Error:** `column "user_id" does not exist`  
**Solution:** Your clients table might not have a user_id column. Check your schema.
